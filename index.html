        <h2 id="trib1">Early Life</h2>
        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
          centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
          father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a
          housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram
          and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
          family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties
          and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who
          claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between
          the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and
          Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the
          family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
          poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's
          meager income.

          <h2 id="trib1">Post-secondary education</h2>
          <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had
            a
            strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. <br /><br /></p>

          <h2 id="trib1">Higher Studies</h2>
          <p>After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
            attend Saint Joseph's
            College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics
            in
            1954. <br /><br /></p>

          <h2 id="trib1">Studies at University</h2>
          <p>He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
            While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
            threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days.
            <br /><br />
          </p>

          <h2 id="trib1">After Studies</h2>
          <p>Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and
            asking you to meet a
            difficult deadline." He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed
            ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.<br /><br /></p>

            <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
              Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
              Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development
              Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his
              choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space
              scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba
              Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space
              Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle
              (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had
              first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam
              received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.


              Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
              In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight
              Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam
              made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which
              proved to be successful.

              Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
              representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also
              directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from
              the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime
              Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers
              under Kalam's directorship.Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the
              true nature of these classified aerospace projects.His research and educational leadership brought
              him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile
              programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to
              the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal
              for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after
              another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating â‚¹ 3.88 billion
              for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the
              chief executive.Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including
              Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile,
              although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.

              Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research
              and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted
              during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the
              Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media
              coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the
              director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and
              criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report. Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.

              In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the
              "Kalam-Raju Stent".In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural
              areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".[<br /><br />

            Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential
            election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term
            lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.

            On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they
            would nominate Kalam for the post of President, and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist
            Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam,
            Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.Kalam said of the
            announcement of his candidature:

            I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I
            was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.
            In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil
            Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.

            At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in office
            provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election. However, two days
            later, he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving
            Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.He was proposed by third front named United National
            Progressive Alliance leader J. Jayalalithaa and coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders Mulayam Singh
            Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala, but he did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA
            constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.

            Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in April
            claimed that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term. After the reports, social
            networking sites witnessed a number of people supporting his candidature. The BJP potentially backed
            his nomination[failed verification], saying that the party would lend their support if the Trinamool
            Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress proposed him for the 2012 presidential
            election. A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also expressed
            their support for Kalam.Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the
            solitary supporter. On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said of
            his decision not to do so:

            Many, many citizens have also expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love and affection for me and
            the aspiration of the people. I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I respect it.
            I want to thank them for the trust they have in me.
